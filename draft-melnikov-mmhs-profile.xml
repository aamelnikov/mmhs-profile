          A Military Message Handling System (MMHS) processes formal messages ensuring release,
          distribution, security, and timely delivery across national and international
          strategic and tactical networks.  The MMHS Elements of Service are defined as
          a set of extensions to the ITU-T X.400 (1992) international standards and are specified
          in STANAG 4406 Edition 2 or <xref target="ACP123"/>.  This document specifies an MMHS Profile for how a comparable
  messaging service can be provided using Email Message Format <xref target="RFC5322"/>,
  SMTP <xref target="RFC5321"/> and their extensions.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="MMHS Profile Summary">
       <t>
          This non-normative section provides a summary of the sections in this document that specifies the MMHS Profile; refer to the sections that follow for a normative specification of the MMHS Profile.
        </t>
        <t>
          The fundamental purpose of STANAG 4406 Edition 2 or <xref target="ACP123"/> is to define a common message service to be provided between all participating organisations (or domains).  STANAG 4406 Edition 2 and <xref target="ACP123"/> achieve this by defining the Military Messaging Elements of Service (EoS) that are required to be supported. <xref target="ACP123"/> defines EoS as 'abstractions that describe features of a system for which the user of that system has direct access'. Note for the purposes of this MMHS Profile a 'user' can be described as: an end user; an organisation (or domain); a Mail User Agent (MUA); a Mail Submission Agent (MSA); or, a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA). 
        </t>
        <t>
          The MMHS Profile adopts the EoS defined in <xref target="ACP123"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          <xref target="Elements-of-Service"/> provides a developer-friendly summary (<xref target="Profile-Support"/>) and a detailed definition (<xref target="Basic-Elements-of-Service"/>, <xref target="Optional-Elements-of-Service"/> and <xref target="Military-Elements-of-Service"/>) that specifies:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              the mandatory and optional EoS to be supported in order to claim conformance to this MMHS Profile; and,
            </t>
            <t>
              the relevant IETF RFC Standard that provides the comparable EoS.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          <xref target="Security-Services"/> describes generic security services independent of the mechanisms used to provide the security (<xref target="General-Security-Elements-of-Service"/>) and profiles the use of Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) protocols (<xref target="RFC5751"/>, <xref target="RFC5652"/> and <xref target="RFC2634"/>) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures (<xref target="RFC6376"/>) for implementing these security services (<xref target="Security-Profile"/>).
        </t>
        <t>
          In order to implement an MMHS a number of components are typically deployed to support <xref target="ACP123"/>. The MMHS profile (defined in this document) identifies the requirements on the following SMTP MMHS components in order to claim conformance with the EoS specified in <xref target="Elements-of-Service"/> and the security services specified in <xref target="Security-Services"/> (Note: additional SMTP extensions that provide additional SMTP functionality but do not have equivalent <xref target="ACP123"/> EoS are also included in these sections):
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              Mail User Agent (<xref target="mua-reqs"/>);
            </t>
            <t>
              Mail Submission Agent (<xref target="msa-reqs"/>); and,
            </t>
            <t>
              Mail Transfer Agent (<xref target="mta-reqs"/>);
            </t>
        </list>

      <section title="Introduction">
        <t>
          The military messaging elements of service are adopted from <xref target="ACP123"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Many of these elements of service are derived from the X.400 standards upon which <xref target="ACP123"/> is based. 
          </t>
        <t>
          Note that some of the X.400 elements of service do not have an equivalent in a SMTP messaging system. It is not the intention of this profile to define additional SMTP functionality and consequently a number of the military messaging elements of service are not supported by this profile. 
        </t>
        <t>
          Specifically, the physical delivery, conversion (implicit or explicit) and alternate recipient elements of service are not supported by this profile. 
        </t>
        <t>
          This profile adopts, where appropriate, header fields that are defined in <xref target="RFC2156"/> to support X.400 elements of service that support military messaging elements of service. <xref target="RFC2156"/> has already addressed the issue of conveying many of the X.400 elements of service within an SMTP messaging system.

          <t>
            This element of service enables an Mail User Agent and an Mail Transfer Agent to establish access and manage information associated with access establishment. This includes the ability to identify and validate the identity of the other.
          </t>
          <t>
            Strong authentication in the bind operation is mandatory. Strong authentication MUST be supported using SMTP Extension for Authentication <xref target="RFC4954"/> and SMTP Extension for Secure SMTP over TLS <xref target="RFC3207"/>.

        <section title="Content Type Indication" anchor="Content-Type-Indication">
          <t>
            This element of service enables an originating Mail User Agent to indicate the type of each submitted message. In most cases, the content type will be obvious from the header fields that are present.
          </t>
          <t>
            A Military Message MUST be indicated using the MMHS-Extended-Authorization-Info header field defined in <xref target="RFC6477"/>.

        <section title="Converted Indication" anchor="Converted-Indication">
          <t>
            This element of service indicates to each recipient UA (i.e., on per-recipient basis) that the performed conversion on the Encoded Information Types (EITs) within a delivered message.
          </t>
          <t>
            Security requirements and mechanisms may not allow conversion to take place within the MMHS.
          </t>
          <t>
            However, messages entering the MMHS from a gateway (e.g., a civilian X.400 domain, an ACP 127 tactical gateway) may carry the converted indication.
          </t>
          <t>
            The Converted Indication, if present, MUST use the X400-Received header field as defined in <xref target="RFC2156"/>.

          </t>
          <t>
            The delivery time stamp MUST be determined from the first Received header field, defined in <xref target="RFC5322"/>, present in the message.

          <t>
            This element of service enables cooperating Mail User Agents to convey a globally unique identifier for each Military Message sent or received. This identifier is used in subsequent messages to identify the original Military Message.
          </t>
          <t>
            A Military Message MUST be uniquely identified using the Message-ID header field defined in <xref target="RFC5322"/>.

        An MMHS MAY support security services. The security services specified in this profile are based on the Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) protocols and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures specified in <xref target="RFC6376"/>. The S/MIME protocols Message Specification <xref target="RFC5751"/>, Cryptographic Message Syntax <xref target="RFC5652"/> and Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME <xref target="RFC2634"/> specify a consistent way to securely send and receive MIME messages providing end to end integrity, authentication, non-repudiation and confidentiality. DKIM's primary purpose is to define an organization-level digital signature authentication framework for Internet email, using public key cryptography and using the domain name service as its key server technology. However, it is possible to administer DKIM to support user-level signature granularity. This section describes the generic security services and profiles the use of <xref target="RFC5751"/>, <xref target="RFC5652"/>, <xref target="RFC2634"/> and <xref target="RFC6376"/>.

        <section title="Access Control" anchor="Access-Control">
          <t>
            The Access Control security service provides a means of enforcing the authorization of users to originate and receive messages. Access controls are performed in each MMHS domain in accordance with the security policy in force. MMHS systems MAY enforce their own native security policies, plus any other security policies that have been bilaterally agreed.
          </t>
          <t>
            An MMHS providing the access control service MUST perform access control decisions based on comparing the sensitivity information conveyed in a security label (<xref target="Security-Labels"/>) with a user's authorizations.

        <section title="Authentication of Origin" anchor="Authentication-Of-Origin">
          <t>
            The Authentication of Origin security service provides assurance that the message was originated by the user indicated as the sender by digitally signing the message. However, it must be noted that the implementation of the MMHS security services is dependent upon the security and assurance requirements that are to be met by those MMHS security services. As such, the identity of the signer of the MMHS message may be the user, the role the user is performing or the organization (or domain) the user belongs to.
          </t>
          <t>
            If the MMHS provides security services it MUST support the Authentication of Origin service.
          </t>
          <t>
            The MMHS SHOULD implement this service on origination supporting the SignedData content type (profiled in <xref target="Signed-Data-CT"/>) to apply a digital signature to a MMHS message or, in a degenerate case where there is no signature information, to convey certificates.
          </t>
          <t>
            Alternatively the MMHS MAY implement this service on origination supporting DKIM (profiled in <xref target="DKIM-Signatures"/>) to apply a digital signature to a MMHS message.
          </t>
          <t>
            On reception the MMHS MUST support verification of S/MIME and DKIM digital signatures.

          <t>
            The Non-repudiation of Origin security service provides the recipient with evidence that demonstrates, to a third-party, who originated the message, and will protect against any attempt by the message originator to falsely deny having sent the message. However, it must be noted that the implementation of the MMHS security services is dependent upon the security and assurance requirements that are to be met by those MMHS security services. As such, the identity of the signer of the MMHS message may be the user, the role the user is performing or the organization (or domain) the user belongs to.
          </t>
          <t>

          <t>
            The Message Integrity security service provides a method of ensuring the content that was received by the recipient(s) is the same as that which was sent by the originator. However, it must be noted that the implementation of the MMHS security services is dependent upon the security and assurance requirements that are to be met by those MMHS security services. As such, the identity of the signer of the MMHS message may be the user, the role the user is performing or the organization (or domain) the user belongs to.
          </t>

          <t>
            The Message Data Separation security service protects against unauthorized disclosure of the message, and separates data contained in one message from that contained in another message. This service can help to enforce need to know restrictions, or enables multiple different user communities to share the same secure network. The service is independent of the network and systems transporting the message.

            The MMHS MAY implement this service supporting the EnvelopedData content type (profiled in <xref target="Enveloped-Data-CT"/>) to apply privacy protection to a message. A sender needs to have access to a public key for each intended message recipient to use this service. This content type does not provide authentication.

            The Security Label security service provides a method for associating security labels with objects in the MMHS. This then allows a security policy to define what entities can handle messages containing associated security labels. The security label associated with a message MUST indicate the security policy to be followed along with the sensitivity, compartments, and other handling caveats associated with the message. This service can be used for purposes such as access control or a source of routing information.

          <t>
            By default, <xref target="RFC5751"/> secures MIME message body parts, excluding the message header fields. If the MMHS implements S/MIME security services then the MMHS SHOULD provide a mechanism for securing the message header fields. <xref target="RFC5751"/> includes a mechanism for protecting the header fields where the whole message is wrapped in a message/rfc822 MIME media type. However, this approach can be problematic for non-S/MIME aware MUAs and does not provide a mechanism for signing a subset of message header fields.
          </t>
          <t>
          If the MMHS provides security services this profile requires that the MMHS SHOULD support DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures profiled in <xref target="DKIM-Signatures"/> for digitally signing the MMHS message header fields.
          </t>
          <t>
            The MMHS MUST include at least the following header fields to be signed (note that if a header field is absent, DKIM will provide protection from insertion of the header field):
